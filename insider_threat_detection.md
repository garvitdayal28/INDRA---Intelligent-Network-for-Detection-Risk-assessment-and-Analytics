# PS3: AI-Powered Insider Threat Detection System

## Problem Statement
Insider threats represent one of the most complex and damaging cybersecurity challenges faced by modern organizations. Unlike external attacks, insider threats originate from individuals within the organization — employees, contractors, or partners — who may intentionally or unintentionally expose sensitive information. Such incidents can include unauthorized data access, confidential file transfers, suspicious email communication, or system misuse.

Participants are required to design and develop an AI-based system capable of identifying insider threats by analyzing structured activity data. The solution should include:

- A detection engine that identifies anomalous or high-risk behavior  
- A dashboard that presents actionable insights and alerts  
- A data processing module that transforms raw logs into structured datasets suitable for analysis  

The goal is to build an end-to-end solution that strengthens internal security monitoring and supports proactive risk mitigation.

## Objectives

### 1. Detection Engine
Develop a reliable detection mechanism that analyzes structured organizational activity data to identify insider threats. The model should prioritize high precision and recall while reducing false positives and false negatives.

### 2. Visualization and Insight Platform
Create a lightweight, intuitive dashboard that displays:
- Real-time alerts  
- Behavioral trends  
- Summary statistics and risk indicators  

The interface should enable security teams to interpret and act upon insights efficiently.

### 3. Dataset Processing Module
Design a pipeline that converts raw logs (e.g., network traffic, system logs, application logs, or email logs) into structured datasets. The processed data should be directly compatible with the detection engine.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Model Performance
- Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy  
- Ability to balance detection sensitivity with false alarm reduction  

### 2. Dashboard Quality
- Clarity and usability  
- Interactivity and practical relevance  

### 3. Data Engineering Capability
- Effectiveness in parsing and structuring diverse log types  
- Scalability and efficiency  

### 4. System Scalability
Ability to handle large volumes of organizational data.

### 5. Privacy and Security Measures
- Implementation of anonymization techniques  
- Secure data storage and transmission mechanisms

## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Requirements
- Core logic and algorithms must be implemented independently  
- Direct copying of external solutions is not permitted  
- Teams must clearly document architectural decisions, models used, and custom implementations  

---

## Dataset Suggestions
Teams must use the publicly available Carnegie Mellon University Insider Threat Dataset.

Preprocessing tools:
- Pandas  
- Spark  
- Dask  

Possible features:
- Timestamps  
- User behavior sequences  
- Login patterns  
- Access histories

## Advanced Modeling Approaches (Optional)

### Detection Techniques
- Autoencoders or LSTMs for sequential anomaly detection  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model user-activity relationships  
- Unsupervised clustering methods such as DBSCAN or HDBSCAN  
- Ensemble models such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting  

### Visualization
- Streamlit, Dash, or Flask-based dashboards  
- Plotly, Seaborn, or D3.js  

### Data Pipeline
- Log ingestion using Kafka  
- Workflow orchestration using Airflow, Prefect, or Luigi  
- NLP models for analyzing textual logs or email content  

---

## Privacy Measures
- Hashing or pseudonymization of sensitive fields  
- Encryption (e.g., AES-256) for stored and transmitted data  

---

## Deployment (Optional but Encouraged)
- Cloud deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure  
- Containerization using Docker  

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Functional Prototype
- Detection Engine  
- Dashboard Interface  
- Dataset Processing Module (if implemented)  

All components must be integrated into a unified system.

### 2. Deployment (Optional but Preferred)
- Hosted version of the solution  
- Access credentials or URL for evaluation  

### 3. Source Code
- Clean, modular, well-documented code  
- Repository link or compressed archive  

### 4. Documentation
- Technical architecture overview  
- Setup instructions  
- Privacy implementation details  

### 5. Demo Video (5–10 minutes)
- Demonstration of threat detection  
- Dashboard walkthrough  
- Dataset processing overview  
- Cloud deployment (if applicable)  

### 6. Performance Report
- Evaluation metrics  
- Brief analysis of model performance
